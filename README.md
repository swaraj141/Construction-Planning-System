Phase 1: Data Engineering & Foundation (Months 1–3)The AI is only as good as the "rules" it understands. We start by building the data fabric.Knowledge Ingestion: Centralize historical project data (Gantt charts, BIM models, budget reports) into a scalable cloud repository (e.g., AWS Redshift or Snowflake).Constraint Mapping: Digitizing "hard constraints" like concrete curing times, safety regulations (OSHA), and local building codes into a Vector Database.Stakeholder Workshops: Map the workflows of contractors vs. architects to ensure the UI solves actual friction points (e.g., manual data entry).Deliverable: A unified data environment and a compliance "guardrail" library.Phase 2: Generative Engine Development (Months 4–7)This is the core of the scope—building the brain that creates the plans.LLM Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune a generative model on construction-specific nomenclature and logical dependencies.Optimization Layer: Develop the engine that simulates millions of permutations to find the "Critical Path" while minimizing material waste.Scenario "What-If" Testing: Build the capability for the AI to re-calculate an entire 12-month schedule instantly if a supply chain delay is reported.Deliverable: Alpha version of the Generative Planning Engine.Phase 3: UI/UX & Integration (Months 8–11)Transforming complex data into a collaborative, user-friendly platform.The Adaptive Interface: Design a modern web dashboard that visualizes AI schedules through interactive Gantt charts and 3D resource heatmaps.API Ecosystem: Build bi-directional integrations with Procore, Autodesk Revit, and SAP so data flows seamlessly between design and the field.Real-time Insights: Implement a backend using WebSockets to allow multiple stakeholders to see AI-adjusted plans update live.Deliverable: Beta Platform with active third-party connectivity.Phase 4: Pilot Launch & Adaptive Learning (Months 12–14)Validating the novelty—how the system improves over time.Shadow Pilots: Deploy BuildWise on 3 live projects. Compare AI-generated forecasts against traditional manual scheduling.Reinforcement Learning (RLHF): Implement a feedback loop where project managers "approve" or "edit" AI suggestions, teaching the model human preferences.Impact Audit: Measure KPIs like reduction in material waste and project duration to validate ROI.Deliverable: Production-ready platform and first "Impact Report."🛠️ Technology Stack OverviewLayerRecommended TechnologyPurposeGenerative AIFine-tuned LLMs + NLPTo interpret prompts and generate natural-language project summaries.OptimizationConstraint Satisfaction AlgorithmsTo handle the "math" of resource leveling and scheduling.FrontendReact / Next.jsFor a responsive, modern, and collaborative user interface.BackendPython (FastAPI/Django)Ideal for AI integration and high-performance data processing.IntegrationsRESTful APIs / GraphQLSeamless connectivity with Procore, Oracle, and cost databases.
